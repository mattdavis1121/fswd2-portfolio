                    Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. When you buy that first
                    tube of paint it gives you an artist license. We'll make some happy little bushes here. When you do
                    it
                    your way you can go anywhere you choose. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the
                    creator.

                    That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. A beautiful little sunset. Just let go - and
                    fall
                    like a little waterfall. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Maybe there
                    was
                    an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he
                    fell into the river and drowned. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

                    create an almighty tree that fast? Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home
                    and
